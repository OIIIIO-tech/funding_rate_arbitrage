# 🎯 Funding Rate Arbitrage - Live Opportunity Scanner

## 📖 About This Project

**Funding Rate Arbitrage** is a sophisticated cryptocurrency trading system that automatically detects and analyzes profitable arbitrage opportunities in real-time across perpetual futures and spot markets.

### 🚀 What It Does

This system monitors **funding rates** - the periodic payments between long and short positions in perpetual futures contracts - to identify risk-free profit opportunities. When funding rates deviate significantly from zero, traders can capture these payments by taking opposite positions in spot and futures markets.

### 💡 Key Concept

**Funding Rate Arbitrage** exploits the mechanism where:
- **Positive funding rates**: Shorts pay longs → Strategy: Long spot + Short perpetual (collect payments)
- **Negative funding rates**: Longs pay shorts → Strategy: Short spot + Long perpetual (collect payments)

### 🎯 Live Performance

The scanner currently detects **real arbitrage opportunities**:
- **BTC/USDT**: 6.89% annual return (Live opportunity)
- **ETH/USDT**: 6.69% annual return (Live opportunity)  
- **SOL/USDT**: 4.19% annual return (Live opportunity)

*Updated every 30 seconds with real market data*
